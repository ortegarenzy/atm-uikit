# ATM UIKit

An application created in Swift using UIKit that allows you to withdraw amounts based on the denominations of 1000, 500 and 100. It will display an alert if the amount is invalid or greater than 10,000. 
If the amount is withdrawable, it will display a screen that displays the breakdown of the different bills withdrawn. As an additional logic, the ATM app stores the remaining bills it has based on the 
amounts withdrawn on the transactions since the application has been opended. It will display an alert if there are no available bill to be dispense on the given amount.
